## React Native Experiment

We would like to do one experiment: We want to load a grid view with 1000 images(2mb to 5mb each). Need to see the loading, scrolling, thumbnail loading performance in React native vs iOS and Android platforms.

### Includes

- [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- [RecyclerListView](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview)
- [FastImage](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image)

### Running it

```
npm install
npm run ios||android
```
